Insecurity Index Project
Project Description

The Insecurity Index ranks countries based on their security levels using a logarithmic scale for murder rates (per 100,000 inhabitants), control over territory, and armed conflict deaths. The goal is to provide an insightful and actionable index that helps understand and compare the safety and stability of nations.
